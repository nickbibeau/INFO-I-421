This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Compute Entropy for Set
entropy_set <- entropy.gini(counts, type=2)$entropy
# Declaring empty vectors
classes <- vector()
entropy <- vector()
w <- vector()
info <- vector()
gain <- vector() 
lens_table <- as.table()
for (i in 1: (ncol(lenses) - 1)) {
  classes[i] <- colnames(lenses[ , i])
  values = distinct(lenses[,i])
  for (j in 1: length(values)) {
    entropy = vector()
    entropy[j] <- entropy.gini(lenses[j,], type=2)$entropy

  }  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
